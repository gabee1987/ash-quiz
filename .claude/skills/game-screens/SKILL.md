# Game screens

Screens are pure functions of the latest snapshot (see `web-ui`). Colours and motion are in `design-system` and `motion`.

## Phone (`/play/$pin`, join page)

- Phone layout is the default; the screen view is the exception. Touch targets at least 48 px high. Answer buttons fill the width and the lower half of the viewport.
- `/play/*` has no `AppHeader`: the root layout shows `GameMenu` instead (a fixed round button top right with the language and colour mode). Keep the top right corner of phone game screens free, or give the element `pr-12` / `mr-12`.
- A question image on the phone sits in a `flex-3` box (absolutely positioned `img`, `max-h-full`, `object-contain`, `min-h-28`) next to the answers' `flex-2` box, so image and answers fit the screen together (a 390 × 844 phone with four options shows everything without scrolling).
- Use `100dvh` based layouts, `viewport-fit=cover` safe-area padding, no horizontal scroll, no hover-only affordances.
- Forms: `inputMode="numeric"` for the PIN, `autoComplete="off"`, `enterKeyHint`.
- A persistent thin status bar shows connection state when it is not `connected`, using `errors.connectionLost`.
- Timer: a shrinking bar plus a ring with the seconds, driven by `requestAnimationFrame` against the clock offset. Stop at 0, never negative; the last five seconds turn red and pulse.
- Join: the PIN comes first, the name and avatar only after the PIN is accepted. `PinInput` (one box per digit) and the lazy `QrScanner` (camera + `jsqr`, decoded on the device; offered only when `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` exists, i.e. HTTPS or localhost). `pinFromScan` in `lib/pin.ts` accepts the join link, a play link or the bare digits.
- End-of-game review (`podium.tsx`): one `<details>` card per question, open by default, the question as a heading alone on the first row, level result chips, the card tinted with its result tone (`--tone`) through sRGB `color-mix` (see `design-system`).

## Projector (`/screen/$pin`)

Targets 1080p at 2 to 4 m viewing distance: question text at 40 px or more, options at 32 px or more, the QR code at least 300 px in the lobby, the join URL spelled out next to it. Shows answer count live, the distribution bar chart in reveal (`RevealLayout`, shared with the results summary: question and image left, bars right, figures below), top 10 in scoreboard, top 3 podium at the end (`PodiumStage`, also used on phones in its compact form). If the screen is also the host (same browser session), Space or Right arrow triggers "next" and the same action floats as a button bottom right; otherwise the screen is passive. The projector keeps its header.

## Host control (`/host/games/$pin`)

During a running question `LiveQuestion` shows the answers coming in. In reveal, scoreboard and when a question is shown again, `ShownQuestion` (`features/host/shown-question.tsx`) says what the screens show and gives the question's type, time, points, image, correct answer, answered and right counts, average time, the fastest right answer, the bars and who did not answer.

## Results page (`/host/results/$gameId`)

Summary first (`results-summary.tsx`: figures, podium, easiest and hardest question from the pure, tested `features/results/summary.ts`), then tabs: Players (with the team table in team mode) and Questions.
