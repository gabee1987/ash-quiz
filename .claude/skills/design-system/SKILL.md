# Design system

## Primitives

shadcn/ui components (Radix underneath) copied into `src/components/ui/` and edited for our look: `Button` (variants `default`, `secondary`, `outline`, `ghost`, `destructive`, `success`, `link`; sizes `sm`, `default` (48 px), `lg`, `xl`, `icon`, `icon-sm`), `Card`, `Input`, `Textarea`, `Label`, `Select`, `Switch`, `Checkbox`, `RadioGroup`, `Dialog`, `Sheet`, `Tabs`, `Badge`, `Tooltip`, `DropdownMenu`, `Skeleton`, `Separator`, `Progress`, `Toaster` (Sonner). Add more with `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <name>` from `apps/web`, then run prettier on that one file (the repo as a whole is not Prettier-formatted, so never run it wider) and replace any hard-coded English text (e.g. "Close") with `t()`.

## Colour

- **Tokens only.** Colours come from semantic tokens in `styles.css` (`bg-background`, `bg-card`, `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`, `bg-primary`/`text-primary-foreground`, `secondary`, `muted`, `accent`, `destructive`, `success`, `warning`, `border`, `input`, `ring`, plus `primary-edge` and friends for the chunky button edge). Never `bg-white/10`, `text-red-300` and similar. Exceptions: the answer palettes in `styles.css` (read through `option-colours.ts`), the QR code's white background (cameras need dark on white) and the medal colours.
- **Mixing with `--card` or `--border`: use `color-mix(in srgb, …)`.** White `--card` is `oklch(1 0 0)` with hue 0, so an oklch mix drags the hue: green turns beige in light mode and teal in dark. oklch mixes are fine between two saturated colours or with `black`/`transparent`.
- **Colour mode**: `light`, `dark` or `system` per device in localStorage `quizmoo.mode`, applied as `data-mode` on `<html>` before first paint by `public/mode-init.js` (a file, not an inline script: the CSP allows scripts from `'self'` only). `lib/mode.ts` is the store (`useMode`, `setMode`). `dark:` variants follow `data-mode`. Tokens have light values under `:root` and dark values under `:root[data-mode='dark']`, so most components need no `dark:` class at all.
- **Game themes**: `settings.theme` (playful `classic`, `arcade`, `sunset`, `mint`, `ocean`, `berry`, `forest`; subdued `graphite`, `navy`, `petrol`, `stone`, `bordeaux` for formal events, with chroma below 1) is a quiz setting. `/play/$pin`, `/screen/$pin` and `/host/games/$pin` call `useGameTheme(snapshot.settings)`, which sets `data-theme` and `data-palette` on `<html>` (so dialogs and toasts in portals follow them). A theme only overrides `--hue`, `--hue-accent`, `--tint` and `--chroma`; every token is computed from them, so both modes keep their contrast. The tokens are declared on `:root` and on every `[data-theme]` element, so a theme on a wrapper (the editor's phone preview) renders inside the page without changing it. Swatches for pickers come from `lib/themes.ts`, which mirrors the hues in `styles.css`.
- **Answer options** are identified by index. Their colours come from the game's answer palette (`settings.answerPalette`: `vivid`, `candy`, `neon`, `earth`, and the calm `muted`, `corporate`; six colours per palette in red, blue, yellow, green, orange, purple families, defined in `styles.css` under `[data-palette]` and read through `optionVars(index)` + `optionFill` from `option-colours.ts`) and their marks from the symbol set (`settings.answerSymbols`: `shapes`, `letters`, `numbers`, `icons`; `OptionSymbol` in `icons.tsx`). Colour is never the only signal. Palettes are independent of the theme and the colour mode, so answers never blend into the background.

## Look

Nunito (self-hosted via `@fontsource-variable/nunito`, never a font CDN), headings `font-black`/`font-extrabold`, 12 to 24 px radii (`rounded-xl` to `rounded-2xl`), `shadow-soft` on cards, solid buttons with a darker bottom edge that sink when pressed. Cards that carry a status get a visible identity: a solid tinted header and border, not a faint transparent wash.

## Accessibility

Every interactive element shows a focus ring (`focus-visible:ring-[3px] focus-visible:ring-ring`); text meets 4.5:1 in both modes (`e2e/a11y.e2e.ts` runs axe in both modes); `prefers-reduced-motion` ends all CSS animations and transitions immediately (global rule in `styles.css`).
