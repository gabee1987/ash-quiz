# Scoring

Scoring is part of the pure engine (`apps/server/src/game`, see `game-engine`). The web app never scores; it shows what the snapshot says.

## Points

Let `P` = question points, `T` = time limit in ms, `t` = the answer's stored `timeMs` (answer time minus `questionStartedAt` when it was given, so a later resume does not change it; clamped to `[0, T]`). A changed answer (`settings.answerChanges`) carries the time of the change.

- Correct answer, speed bonus on: `round(P * (1 - t / T / 2))`, so between `P` and `P/2`.
- Correct answer, speed bonus off: `P`.
- Wrong or missing answer: `0`.
- Poll: always `0`, `correct` is `null`.
- Streak: a correct answer raises the player's `streak`, a wrong or missing one resets it to 0; polls, skipped questions and answers waiting for host grading leave it unchanged (grading then moves it). With `settings.streakBonus` a correct answer's points include `streakBonusFor(streak)` = `min(streak - 1, 5) * 100`, also stored as `bonus` on the answer record.

## Correctness per type

| Type | Correct when |
|---|---|
| single | `optionId === correctOptionId` |
| multiple | set of `optionIds` equals set of `correctOptionIds` (all or nothing) |
| truefalse | `value === correct` |
| text | `normalise(value)` equals `normalise(a)` for some accepted answer; with no accepted answers, `correct` stays `null` until `gradeText` |
| number | `abs(value - correct) <= tolerance` |
| order | `optionIds` equals the stored option order exactly (all or nothing); the answer must be a permutation of the options |

Ordering questions store the correct order as the option order. `toPublicQuestion` shows them shuffled with `displayOrder` (`order.ts`): seeded by the question id, never the correct order, the same for everyone. Their reveal distribution counts, per option, the players who put it in its right place.

`normalise`: trim, lowercase, NFD then strip combining marks (so "Győr" matches "gyor"), collapse internal whitespace.

## Teams and ranks

Team mode: after scoring a question, each team's gain is `round(mean(points of all its current members))`, members without an answer counting as 0. Individual scores are still kept and shown.

Ranks: dense ranking by score descending, ties share a rank; stable on name for display.

## Tests

`engine.test.ts` covers every scoring row, the normaliser, team averaging with a non-answering member and dense ranking with ties.
